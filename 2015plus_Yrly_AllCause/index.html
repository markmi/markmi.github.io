Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin<br />are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased.

National Vital Statistics<br />System, Provisional Mortality on CDC WONDER Online Database. Data are from the final Multiple Cause of Death Files, 2018-2020,<br />and from provisional data for years 2021-2022, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through<br />the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Accessed at http://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html on Aug 9, 2022 4:50:18 PM<br />---<br />Caveats:<br />1. <b>NOTE: </b>On June 6, 2022, the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) cause of death coding system began a system-wide<br />upgrade, which required a temporary suspension of routine NVSS surveillance reporting. The upgrade required all 2022 death<br />records to be reprocessed into the system. As routine NVSS surveillance reporting resumes, users may temporarily observe lower<br />death counts for prior weeks in 2022 as the backlog is reprocessed and reloaded into the system.<br />2. Deaths of persons with Age "Not Stated" are included in "All" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,<br />so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:<br />http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated.<br />3. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin "Not Stated" are included in "All" counts and rates, but are not distributed among<br />Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:<br />http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated.<br />4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the<br />funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis<br />of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin<br />are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:<br />http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Racial Differences.<br />5. The population figures for years 2021 and 2020 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage<br />2020 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on July 27, 2021. The population figures for year 2019 are single-race<br />estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2019 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 25,<br />2020. The population figures for year 2018 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2018<br />postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 20, 2019.<br />6. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the<br />resident population that is under one year of age.
